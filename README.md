# Post View Counter for WordPress

A simple WordPress plugin snippet to count and store the number of views for each post using a custom field.

## Description

This small PHP script increments a custom field (`post_view`) every time a single post is viewed. It uses WordPress' native `get_post_meta` and `update_post_meta` functions to store and update the view count securely.

The counter is triggered when a visitor loads the page (via `wp_head` hook), ensuring accurate tracking of each individual view.

## How It Works

- Checks if the current page is a single post.
- Retrieves the current view count from the `post_view` meta key.
- Increments the count by 1 on each visit.
- Updates the value in the database.

## Code Overview

```php
function set_post_view_custom_field() {
    if ( is_single() ) {
        global $post;
        $post_id = $post->ID;
        $count = 1;
        $post_view = get_post_meta( $post_id, 'post_view', true );
        if ( $post_view ) {
            $count = $post_view + 1;
        }
        update_post_meta( $post_id, 'post_view', $count );
    }
}
add_action( 'wp_head', 'set_post_view_custom_field' );
```

> ⚠️ Note: This is a basic snippet. For production use, consider adding user role checks, caching compatibility, or exclusion rules.

## Usage

1. Add this code to your theme’s `functions.php` file or include it as a custom plugin.
2. View counts will be stored under the custom field key `post_view`.
3. You can retrieve and display the view count anywhere in your theme like this:

```
php
$post_views = get_post_meta( get_the_ID(), 'post_view', true );
echo 'Views: ' . ($post_views ? $post_views : 0);
